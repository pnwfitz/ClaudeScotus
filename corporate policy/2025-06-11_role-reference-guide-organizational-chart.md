## Session Handoff Guidelines

### 🟢 **Primary Session Patterns**
- **SCOTUS Analysis**: Supreme Court Specialist → Law Partner validation
- **Technical Implementation**: System Architect → Staff Engineer → Full-Stack Engineer
- **Data Processing**: Data Specialist → Supreme Court Specialist analysis
- **Session Coordination**: Product Manager orchestration with role-specific handoffs

### 🟡 **Secondary Coordination**
- **Finance Controller**: Session efficiency analysis and workflow optimization
- **Role Designer**: When session patterns need optimization or role improvements
- **Cross-validation**: Multiple Claude instances for critical prediction validation

### 🔴 **Avoid Session Mixing**
- **Technical roles**: In pure legal analysis sessions
- **Legal roles**: In pure technical implementation sessions
- **Coordination roles**: In domain-specific deep work sessions

## Session Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern Category | Specific Issues | Correct Approach | Impact |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **❌ Wrong Role Activation** | Supreme Court Specialist for technical implementation | Use System Architect/Staff Engineer | Poor quality, wasted time |
| **❌ Wrong Role Activation** | Product Manager for detailed legal analysis | Use Supreme Court Specialist | Inaccurate analysis |
| **❌ Wrong Role Activation** | Finance Controller for case analysis or coding | Use appropriate domain expert | Ineffective session |
| **❌ Wrong Role Activation** | System Architect for routine implementation tasks | Use Full-Stack Engineer | Resource misallocation |
| **❌ Session Scope Confusion** | Mixing legal and technical in single session | Separate sessions by domain | Context confusion |
| **❌ Session Scope Confusion** | Wrong role expertise for task domain | Match expertise to need | Poor outcomes |
| **❌ Session Scope Confusion** | Comprehensive analysis when focused needed | Target specific expertise | Inefficient analysis |
| **❌ Session Scope Confusion** | Context switching without handoff documentation | Proper documentation | Lost context |
| **❌ Missing Validation** | SCOTUS predictions without Law Partner validation | Always validate with Law Partner | Accuracy risk |
| **❌ Missing Validation** | Technical architecture without System Architect review | System Architect validation | Technical debt |
| **❌ Missing Validation** | Session efficiency issues without Finance Controller | Finance Controller analysis | Continued inefficiency |
| **❌ Missing Validation** | Role performance without Role Designer consultation | Role Designer optimization | Ongoing problems |

### Critical Avoidance Checklist

- [ ] **Role-Task Alignment**: Correct role selected for task domain
- [ ] **Session Focus**: Single domain focus per session
- [ ] **Expertise Match**: Role expertise matches requirement
- [ ] **Validation Process**: Appropriate validation role involved
- [ ] **Handoff Documentation**: Context preserved between sessions
- [ ] **Domain Separation**: Legal and technical work properly separated

## Session Efficiency Optimization

### ⚡ **Start Focused**
1. **Select appropriate role** for primary task domain
2. **Use role memory triggers** for context loading
3. **Check `CURRENT-STATUS.md`** for session continuity
4. **Apply `/clear`** before major context switches

### ⚡ **Session Handoffs**
- **Update role memory** with key insights and decisions
- **Commit progress** with meaningful git messages
- **Update `CURRENT-STATUS.md`** with next session context
- **Reference issue tags** for traceability

### ⚡ **Context Management**
1. **Use role expertise** within defined scope
2. **Document handoff needs** in session wind-down
3. **Preserve context** in git commits and memory files
4. **Optimize for prediction accuracy** as primary success metric
