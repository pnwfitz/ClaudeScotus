# ClaudeScotus Memory System

## Architecture Overview
This directory contains the institutional memory for all ClaudeScotus roles, following the BaseMemory.md corporate standards for systematic knowledge capture and reuse.

## Directory Structure

### Role-Specific Memory
Each role maintains six categories of memory:

```
memory/
├── {role-name}_decisions/     # Strategic choices and rationale
├── {role-name}_patterns/      # Successful methodologies  
├── {role-name}_lessons/       # Failures and improvements
├── {role-name}_interactions/  # Cross-role collaboration
├── {role-name}_metrics/       # Performance and outcomes
└── {role-name}_context/       # Environmental factors
```

### Implemented Roles
- **product_manager_***: Project coordination, stakeholder alignment, delivery management
- **law_partner_***: Strategic legal authority, client deliverables, business risk assessment
- **supreme_court_specialist_***: Legal analysis, case research, prediction methodology
- **system_architect_***: Technical foundation, architecture decisions, system design
- **staff_engineer_***: Technical leadership, code quality, engineering mentorship
- **full_stack_engineer_***: Implementation, feature development, technical execution
- **data_specialist_***: Legal data processing, evidence compilation, analytical workflows
- **finance_controller_***: Budget management, cost optimization, efficiency enforcement

### Shared Memory
Cross-role accessible institutional knowledge:

```
memory/shared/
├── decisions/     # Strategic decisions visible to multiple roles
├── patterns/      # Methodologies useful across roles
└── lessons/       # Corporate learning for all roles
```

## Memory Standards

### File Format
All memory entries follow BaseMemory.md template:
- Standard YAML frontmatter with date, type, impact, status
- Structured sections for context, details, rationale, outcomes
- Cross-references and tags for knowledge discovery
- Corporate reusability considerations

### Update Protocols
- **Bootstrap**: Roles read relevant memory on activation
- **Active Documentation**: Record decisions, patterns, lessons as they occur
- **Git Integration**: All memory updates committed with meaningful messages
- **Quality Review**: Regular curation and consolidation of memory entries

### Corporate Integration
- **Cross-Project Portability**: Memory patterns work across corporate initiatives
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Successful approaches shared between projects
- **Institutional Learning**: Systematic improvement from corporate experience
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports growing organizational knowledge base
