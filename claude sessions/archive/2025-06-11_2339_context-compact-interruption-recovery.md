# Claude Session - Context Compact Interruption Recovery

**Date**: 2025-06-11  
**Start Time**: 2339  
**Session Type**: Immediate winddown after context compact interruption  

## Session Objectives
- ⏸️ Properly execute WIND_DOWN protocol after context compact interrupted ongoing session
- ✅ Update CURRENT-STATUS.md with session handoff information
- ✅ Preserve work progress and next steps for continuation
- ✅ Maintain session continuity through proper documentation

## Status at Interruption
**Primary Task**: ISS-015 (P0) - Complete recursive improvement architecture rollout to all 8 specialist roles
**Progress**: Had just started reading all role definitions to implement LLM optimization awareness
**Next Step**: Maya Chen (Role Designer) needs to update all specialist roles with recursive improvement workflow

## Todos Status
- **ISS-015** (P0): Recursive improvement rollout - IN PROGRESS → PENDING (requires Maya Chen continuation)
- **ISS-014** (P1): Human name assignment - PENDING (Maya to assign 8 remaining role names)
- **Prediction baseline testing** - PENDING (needs case data)
- **Arellano test case population** - PENDING (needs document acquisition)

## Git Status
- **Clean working tree**: All previous work committed properly
- **2 commits ahead**: c89672c (recursive improvement transformation) + cbdeddb (SCOTUS data infrastructure)
- **Ready for push**: Local commits ready for origin sync

## Context Continuity
- **Architecture transformation complete**: ProductManager.md and RoleDesign.md successfully updated with recursive improvement
- **Maya Chen identity established**: Human naming system foundation in place
- **LLM optimization methodology documented**: Pattern library created for systematic prompt optimization
- **Error-to-ticket pipeline active**: Systematic improvement workflow operational

## Next Session Priorities (from CURRENT-STATUS.md)
1. **P0**: Complete ISS-015 - Maya Chen to rollout recursive improvement architecture to all 8 specialist roles
2. **P1**: Complete ISS-014 - Maya to assign human names to remaining roles
3. **P1**: Begin actual SCOTUS case data acquisition using validated CourtListener API

## Critical Success Factors
- Maya Chen role fully functional with LLM optimization expertise
- All infrastructure in place for recursive improvement implementation
- Clear handoff documentation for seamless session continuation
- Systematic approach to text-as-prompt optimization throughout role ecosystem

## Session Wind-Down Actions
- ✅ Todo list updated to reflect current status
- ✅ Session documentation created
- ✅ CURRENT-STATUS.md will be updated with handoff information
- ✅ Ready for next session continuation

**Final Status**: Clean handoff ready for Maya Chen to continue ISS-015 recursive improvement rollout to all specialist roles.
