# Justice Neil M. Gorsuch - Prediction Profile

**Appointed**: April 2017 by President Trump

## Judicial Philosophy

**Core Principle**: **Libertarian Textualist**  
Gorsuch combines textualist methodology with libertarian instincts, making him the most unpredictable conservative justice. He's willing to reach liberal outcomes when his principled approach demands it.

**Key Philosophical Elements**:
- **Textualism**: Text of law controls, not legislative purpose or intent
- **Originalism**: Constitution/statutes mean what they meant when enacted
- **Libertarian Skepticism**: Suspicious of government power regardless of political valence
- **Individual Liberty**: Strong protection for individual rights against government overreach
- **Anti-Administrative State**: Hostile to federal agency authority and deference

## Voting Patterns & Predictive Framework

### Conservative Baseline (75% of cases)
Gorsuch votes with conservatives on most issues but is the most likely conservative to defect.

**Reliable Conservative Votes**:
- **Religious Liberty**: Strong Free Exercise protections
- **Gun Rights**: Robust Second Amendment interpretation
- **Business Regulation**: Anti-regulatory, pro-business outcomes
- **Abortion**: Generally conservative (though less aggressive than Thomas/Alito)
- **Property Rights**: Strong protection against government taking

### Liberal Departures (20-25% of cases)
Gorsuch frequently breaks with conservatives when libertarian principles demand it:
- **Criminal Procedure**: Strong Fourth Amendment protections
- **Native American Rights**: Consistent supporter of tribal sovereignty
- **Individual Liberty**: Protection against government overreach
- **Due Process**: Procedural rights in criminal and civil contexts

## Key Case Areas for Prediction

### Criminal Justice
**Pattern**: **Surprisingly Liberal**  
**Key Cases**: Carpenter v. United States (digital privacy), various Fourth Amendment cases  
**Reasoning**: Libertarian skepticism of government surveillance and prosecutorial power  
**Prediction Factor**: Will often join liberal bloc on criminal procedure, search/seizure issues

### Administrative Law
**Pattern**: **Anti-Agency Across Political Spectrum**  
**Key Cases**: Consistently votes to limit federal agency authority  
**Reasoning**: Agencies exercise legislative power without constitutional authorization  
**Prediction Factor**: Will vote against federal agencies regardless of liberal or conservative policy implications

### Native American Rights
**Pattern**: **Consistently Pro-Tribal**  
**Key Cases**: McGirt v. Oklahoma (tribal jurisdiction), various sovereignty cases

**Prediction Factor**: Will vote for tribal rights even when conservatives oppose

### LGBTQ+ Rights
**Pattern**: **Textualist Approach**  
**Key Cases**: Bostock v. Clayton County (authored majority protecting transgender employment rights)  
**Reasoning**: Discrimination "because of sex" includes transgender discrimination  
**Prediction Factor**: May reach liberal outcomes through conservative methodology

### Immigration Law
**Pattern**: **Moderate Conservative with Due Process Concerns**  
**Key Cases**: Mixed record on enforcement vs. individual rights  
**Reasoning**: Supports immigration control but concerned about procedural rights  
**Prediction Factor**: Will vote for enforcement measures but require due process protections

### Religious Liberty
**Pattern**: **Strongly Conservative**  
**Key Cases**: Consistently expansive interpretation of Free Exercise

## Strategic Considerations

**Principled Independence**: Gorsuch is most willing to break with conservative coalition for doctrinal consistency, making him genuinely unpredictable.

**Libertarian Wild Card**: His libertarian instincts can lead to liberal outcomes in individual rights cases, especially criminal procedure.

**Textualist Consistency**: May reach liberal results through conservative methodology, as in Bostock.

**Long-term Doctrine**: Gorsuch thinks institutionally about legal doctrine, not just immediate political outcomes.

## Bottom Line for 2Ls

Gorsuch is the **most unpredictable conservative** because his principled textualist approach and libertarian instincts can lead to liberal outcomes. He's not outcome-oriented like Alito or institutionally cautious like Roberts - he follows his judicial philosophy wherever it leads.

**Most Predictable**: Religious liberty, gun rights, business regulation, administrative law challenges  
**Least Predictable**: Criminal procedure, individual liberty cases, civil rights with textual support  
**Wild Card Factor**: His libertarian skepticism of government power can produce surprising liberal votes

**Key Insight**: Gorsuch asks "What does the text require?" rather than "What's the conservative outcome?" This makes him both more principled and more unpredictable than other conservative justices.
