# BaseMemory - Corporate Memory System Template

## Purpose
Foundation template for all role-based memory systems across corporate projects. Provides standardized knowledge capture, pattern recognition, and institutional learning frameworks.

**INHERITANCE NOTE**: All roles automatically inherit this memory architecture through BaseEmployee.md integration.

## Standard Memory Architecture

### Core Memory Categories
Every role maintains these standardized memory types:

#### 1. **Decisions** (`/{domain}/{role}_decisions/`)
- **Purpose**: Record major decisions with rationale and context
- **Format**: Decision title, options considered, criteria used, rationale, outcome
- **Update Triggers**: After strategic choices, policy changes, methodology shifts
- **Retention**: Permanent - decisions inform future choices

#### 2. **Patterns** (`/{domain}/{role}_patterns/`)
- **Purpose**: Successful approaches and repeatable methodologies
- **Format**: Pattern name, context, steps, success indicators, variations
- **Update Triggers**: After successful project completion, effective workflows
- **Retention**: Permanent - patterns enable systematic improvement

#### 3. **Lessons** (`/{domain}/{role}_lessons/`)
- **Purpose**: Failures, errors, and improvement opportunities
- **Format**: What went wrong, why it happened, impact, prevention measures
- **Update Triggers**: After mistakes, failed approaches, corrective actions
- **Retention**: Permanent - failures drive systematic improvement

#### 4. **Interactions** (`/{domain}/{role}_interactions/`)
- **Purpose**: Effective collaboration patterns with other roles
- **Format**: Role combinations, successful handoffs, communication patterns
- **Update Triggers**: After cross-role projects, consultation successes/failures
- **Retention**: 12 months rolling - interaction patterns evolve

#### 5. **Metrics** (`/{domain}/{role}_metrics/`)
- **Purpose**: Performance measurement and outcome tracking
- **Format**: KPIs, success rates, efficiency measures, quality indicators
- **Update Triggers**: After deliverable completion, regular review cycles
- **Retention**: 24 months rolling - trend analysis and improvement tracking

#### 6. **Context** (`/{domain}/{role}_context/`)
- **Purpose**: Environmental factors, constraints, and domain knowledge
- **Format**: Market conditions, regulatory changes, technical evolution
- **Update Triggers**: When external factors change role requirements
- **Retention**: 18 months rolling - context evolves with environment

### Memory File Standards

#### File Naming Convention:
```

```

#### Standard Memory Entry Template:
```markdown
# [Decision/Pattern/Lesson] Title

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Type**: [Decision/Pattern/Lesson/Interaction/Metric/Context]
**Impact**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Status**: [Active/Archived/Superseded]

## Summary
[One sentence description]

## Context
[Relevant background and circumstances]

## Details
[Specific information, steps, or analysis]

## Rationale
[Why this decision/pattern/lesson matters]

## Outcomes
[Results, success indicators, or consequences]

## Future Application
[How this applies to future situations]

## Related Memory
[Links to connected decisions, patterns, or lessons]

**Tags**: #keyword1 #keyword2 #project-name
**Cross-Reference**: [Other roles or memory systems that should know this]
```

## Corporate Memory Integration

### Cross-Role Memory Sharing
- **Strategic Decisions**: Visible to Law Partner, Finance Controller, Product Manager
- **Technical Patterns**: Shared between System Architect, Staff Engineer, Full-Stack Engineer
- **Legal Methodologies**: Accessible to Supreme Court Specialist, Law Partner, Data Specialist
- **Process Improvements**: Available to all roles through Role Designer distribution

### Project Memory Inheritance
When creating new projects:
1. **Copy successful patterns** from similar project domains
2. **Import decision frameworks** that apply across projects
3. **Transfer lesson libraries** to prevent repeated mistakes
4. **Adapt interaction patterns** for new role combinations

### Corporate Knowledge Base
- **Best Practices Library**: Curated patterns from all projects
- **Decision Precedents**: Strategic choices with proven outcomes
- **Failure Analysis**: Systematic learning from corporate mistakes
- **Evolution Tracking**: How roles and processes improve over time

## Memory Maintenance Protocols

### Regular Review Cycles
- **Weekly**: Update current project context and interaction patterns
- **Monthly**: Review and curate decisions and lessons learned
- **Quarterly**: Analyze patterns for corporate best practices
- **Annually**: Archive outdated context, consolidate lessons

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: All entries fact-checked and properly attributed
- **Completeness**: Sufficient detail for future reference and application
- **Clarity**: Understandable by role successors and cross-role teams
- **Relevance**: Focus on actionable insights and reusable knowledge

### Memory System Metrics
- **Usage Frequency**: How often memory entries inform new decisions
- **Accuracy Rate**: Prediction quality of patterns and lessons
- **Cross-Role Value**: Memory entries useful beyond originating role
- **Corporate Impact**: Memory contributions to overall organizational learning

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Role Designers
When creating roles, ensure each role has:
- Proper memory directory structure following BaseMemory standards
- Role-specific memory triggers in workflow protocols
- Clear criteria for what constitutes decision/pattern/lesson worthy events
- Integration with corporate knowledge sharing systems

### For Role Users
When activated, each role should:
1. **Bootstrap from memory**: Read relevant recent entries to understand context
2. **Document actively**: Record decisions, patterns, and lessons as they occur
3. **Cross-reference appropriately**: Link to related role memories when relevant
4. **Maintain quality**: Follow memory entry standards for corporate value

### For System Evolution
Memory systems should:
- **Scale efficiently**: Handle growing volumes of corporate knowledge
- **Integrate seamlessly**: Work across projects and role ecosystems
- **Evolve systematically**: Improve based on usage patterns and outcomes
- **Transfer effectively**: Enable knowledge sharing between projects and teams
