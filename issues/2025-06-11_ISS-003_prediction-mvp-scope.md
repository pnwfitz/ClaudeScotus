# Draft PREDICTION_MVP_SCOPE.md specification
**Issue ID**: ISS-003  
**Opened By**: Product Manager  
**Roles Affected**: Law Partner, Supreme Court Specialist, System Architect  
**Type**: Research  
**Priority**: P1  
**Status**: Open  

## Context  
The ClaudeScotus system needs a clear MVP specification defining the scope, success metrics, inputs, outputs, and timeline for the first production Supreme Court prediction workflow. Without this specification, development lacks clear acceptance criteria and stakeholders cannot align on deliverable expectations.

## Impact  
- Unclear scope leads to feature creep and delayed delivery
- Missing success metrics prevent validation of 80% accuracy goal
- Undefined inputs/outputs create integration and workflow confusion
- Lack of timeline creates unrealistic client expectations
- Role responsibilities remain ambiguous without clear specification

## Proposed Resolution  
* Create `product/PREDICTION_MVP_SCOPE.md` with comprehensive specification
* Define exact inputs required (case briefs, oral arguments, historical data)
* Specify outputs format (prediction confidence, Justice-by-Justice analysis, executive summary)
* List roles and responsibilities for MVP workflow
* Establish success metrics and validation methodology
* Set realistic timeline with key milestones
* Include client deliverable format and presentation requirements

## Acceptance Criteria  
- MVP scope document created in `product/` directory
- Document includes all required sections: inputs, outputs, roles, metrics, timeline
- Specifications are concrete and testable
- Success metrics align with 80% accuracy goal
- Timeline includes specific milestones and dependencies
- Client deliverable format clearly defined
- Law Partner and Supreme Court Specialist review and approve scope
