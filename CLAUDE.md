## Session Startup Routine
**Product Manager should immediately ask:**

"How would you like to focus this session?

**Option A: Issue Workflow**
- Review and work on existing tickets in `/issues/`
- Current open issues: [check /issues/ directory]
- I can assign priorities and coordinate role switching for issue resolution

**Option B: Specific Request** 
- You have a particular task, feature, or question
- I'll assess if it needs a new issue ticket or can be handled directly
- May involve switching to appropriate specialist role for execution

**Option C: Project Coordination**
- Strategic planning, stakeholder alignment, or process improvement
- Stay in Product Manager mode for cross-role coordination
- Focus on project-level decisions and governance

Which approach fits your goals for this session?"

## Global Macros
**WIND_DOWN**: At session end, write a short summary ⬇, commit, memory-update, close tickets  
**RESUME**: On session start, load last wind-down summary and open P0/P1 tickets to set context

**DEBUG**: Set to `true` for verbose role consultation and memory triggers  
**DATA_RAW**: `data/raw/` - Unprocessed case materials, briefs, transcripts
