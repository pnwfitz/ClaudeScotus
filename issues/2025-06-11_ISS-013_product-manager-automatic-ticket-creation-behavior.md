# Product Manager Role Should Automatically Create Tickets for Discovered Issues
**Issue ID**: ISS-013  
**Opened By**: Product Manager  
**Roles Affected**: Product Manager, potentially all roles  
**Type**: Policy  
**Priority**: P2  
**Status**: Open  

## Context  
Product Manager role failed to automatically create ticket for `/winddown` command timing bug when the issue was first discovered. This represents a systematic process compliance failure where identified issues are addressed but not properly tracked in the issue system.

## Impact  
**Process and Governance Impact**:
- Issues discovered and fixed without proper tracking violates issue management requirements
- Missing audit trail for problem identification and resolution
- Inconsistent ticket creation leads to incomplete project visibility
- Violates corporate policy requirement that "all enhancements, bugs, policy changes, and research tasks must be tracked through this system"

## Proposed Resolution  
* Update Product Manager role definition to include mandatory ticket creation behavior
* Add automatic ticket creation trigger when issues are identified during sessions
* Establish systematic process: Discover Issue → Create Ticket → Resolve Issue → Close Ticket
* Include ticket creation verification in role consultation and decision-making processes

**Specific Role Behavior Updates Needed**:
```markdown
## Mandatory Ticket Creation Protocol
**CRITICAL**: When Product Manager identifies any issue, bug, or improvement opportunity:
1. IMMEDIATELY create ISS-### ticket before addressing the issue
2. Reference ticket number in all subsequent work
3. Close ticket only after resolution is complete and verified
4. YOU MUST NOT skip ticket creation even for "small" or "obvious" issues
```

**Examples of Issues Requiring Tickets**:
- Command/workflow bugs (like ISS-012 winddown timing)
- Process improvement opportunities
- Role behavior inconsistencies  
- Technical debt or architectural issues
- Cross-role coordination problems

## Acceptance Criteria  
**Done means**:
- [ ] Product Manager role definition updated with mandatory ticket creation behavior
- [ ] Clear trigger conditions documented for when tickets must be created
- [ ] Process verification steps added to role consultation framework
- [ ] Examples provided of issue types requiring tickets
- [ ] Role memory patterns updated to include ticket creation compliance
- [ ] Integration with `/winddown` command to verify ticket creation behavior
