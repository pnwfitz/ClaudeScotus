# BaseEmployee Architecture Cost Decision

**Type**: Decision
**Status**: Active

## Summary
Approved BaseEmployee inheritance architecture for 90% maintenance cost reduction through elimination of duplicated content across roles.

## Context
Original role approach required updating 8 separate files for any common changes. BaseEmployee inheritance eliminates duplication while preserving role-specific functionality.

## Key Benefits
- **90% maintenance reduction**: Single point of change for common protocols
- **Faster role creation**: Template-based approach vs manual duplication
- **Zero technical debt**: Systematic architecture prevents accumulation
- **Claude Code optimization**: Reduced context size for session efficiency

## Implementation Results
- All 8 roles successfully migrated to inheritance model
- Common protocols consolidated in BaseEmployee.md
- Role-specific content preserved in individual files
- Memory system integration maintained

## Future Application
Apply inheritance pattern to any multi-role system requiring common protocols and standards.
