# Role Designer Decision: Recursive Improvement Architecture Implementation

**Date**: 2025-06-11  
**Decision**: Complete transformation of role ecosystem to recursive improvement system
**Impact**: Fundamental shift from human delegation model to LLM context optimization

## Key Architectural Decisions

### **1. ProductManager Role Transformation**
- **Decision**: Transform PM from "people manager" to "prompt orchestration router"
- **Rationale**: Everything in repo is prompts feeding back into Claude contexts
- **Implementation**: 5-step recursive improvement workflow with error-to-ticket pipeline
- **Impact**: PM now declares "this document is a prompt" and routes through optimization

### **2. Role Designer Role Evolution** 
- **Decision**: Establish Role Designer as recursive improvement optimization engine
- **Rationale**: Need systematic LLM context optimization for 80% SCOTUS prediction accuracy
- **Implementation**: Receive specialist outputs → optimize for LLM context → save where directed
- **Impact**: All text optimized KNOWING it feeds back into Claude

### **3. Human Naming System**
- **Decision**: Assign human names to all roles for easier reference and communication
- **Rationale**: "Ask Maya" more intuitive than "consult Role Designer"
- **Implementation**: Maya Chen assigned, 8 roles pending names
- **Impact**: More natural context switching and role activation

### **4. Error-to-Ticket Pipeline**
- **Decision**: Every failure becomes systematic improvement opportunity
- **Rationale**: Recursive improvement toward 80% accuracy requires systematic learning
- **Implementation**: All errors logged as tickets for enhancement
- **Impact**: Continuous optimization feedback loop established

## Confidence Assessment
**High Confidence**: Architecture transformation addresses fundamental LLM prompting reality
**Medium Confidence**: Human naming system will improve usability
**High Confidence**: Error-to-ticket pipeline enables systematic improvement toward SCOTUS accuracy goal

## Success Metrics
- PM properly routes through context switching workflow
- Role Designer optimizes all specialist outputs for LLM effectiveness  
- Human names used consistently in role references
- Error-to-ticket pipeline generates continuous improvement opportunities
