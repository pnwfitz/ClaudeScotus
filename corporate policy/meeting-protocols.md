## Meeting Structure Standards

### Required Meeting Elements:
1. **Written Agenda** (distributed 24 hours prior)
2. **Cost Justification** (Finance Controller approval for >30 minutes)
3. **Pre-work Completion** (mandatory for all attendees)
4. **Time Keeper** (Finance Controller monitors all meetings)
5. **Decision Documentation** (clear outcomes and next steps)

### Meeting Agenda Template:
```
Meeting Purpose: [One sentence objective]
Duration: [Maximum time limit]
Cost Estimate: [Finance Controller calculation]

Pre-work Required:
- [ ] [Specific preparation items]
- [ ] [Documentation to review]

Agenda Items:
1. [Decision Point] - [Time allocation] - [Expected outcome]
2. [Discussion Topic] - [Time allocation] - [Decision criteria]

Success Criteria:
- [ ] [Specific deliverable]
- [ ] [Clear action items with owners]
```

## Role-Specific Meeting Responsibilities

### Finance Controller (Meeting Efficiency Enforcer):
- Approve all meetings >30 minutes with cost-benefit analysis
- Monitor meeting duration and intervene at time limits
- Track meeting ROI and quarterly efficiency reporting
- Authority to end meetings that exceed value threshold

### Product Manager (Meeting Organizer):
- Ensure agenda clarity and business value justification
- Facilitate cross-role coordination meetings
- Document decisions and distribute action items
- Escalate blocked decisions to appropriate authority

### System Architect (Technical Meetings):
- Provide technical context and options analysis
- Ensure architectural decisions consider long-term implications
- Document technical decisions and rationale
- Define technical pre-work requirements

### Law Partner (Strategic Meetings):
- Frame legal discussions in business impact terms
- Provide final authority on legal strategy decisions
- Ensure legal analysis supports business objectives
- Review meeting outcomes for strategic alignment

## Meeting Alternatives (Preferred Methods)

### Async Documentation Review:
- Technical specifications and architectural proposals
- Legal research and case analysis reports
- Code review and technical feedback
- Status updates and progress reporting

### Decision Matrices:
- Feature prioritization with scoring criteria
- Technical option evaluation with trade-offs
- Risk assessment with probability and impact
- Resource allocation with cost-benefit analysis

### Time-Boxed Slack Threads:
- Quick technical questions and clarifications
- Resource availability and scheduling
- Minor scope and requirement adjustments
- Process clarifications and policy questions

## Meeting Quality Metrics

### Efficiency Targets:
- **Decision Rate**: >80% of agenda items result in clear decisions
- **Action Item Completion**: >90% completion rate within agreed timeframes
- **Meeting ROI**: Measurable value delivery >3x meeting cost
- **Preparation Rate**: >95% attendee pre-work completion

### Monthly Reporting:
- Total meeting hours and cost analysis
- Meeting type distribution and efficiency trends
- Decision quality assessment and outcome tracking
- Process improvement recommendations

## Escalation Procedures

### Meeting Overruns:
1. Finance Controller calls time at limit
2. Meeting organizer proposes: continue, reschedule, or async resolution
3. Majority vote required to extend (max 15 minutes)
4. Automatic post-meeting efficiency review

### Blocked Decisions:
1. Document blocking issues and required information
2. Assign specific research/analysis tasks with deadlines
3. Schedule follow-up decision meeting (max 1 week)
4. Escalate to Law Partner for strategic decisions

### Persistent Meeting Issues:
1. Finance Controller reports quarterly efficiency review
2. Product Manager proposes process improvements
3. System Architect evaluates technical communication patterns
4. Role Designer updates meeting protocols based on learnings

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Prohibited Meeting Activities:
- **Information Dumping**: Reading documents aloud that could be reviewed async
- **Status Updates**: Progress reporting better handled through written updates
- **Open-Ended Brainstorming**: Ideation should happen before meetings with proposals ready
- **Technical Deep-Dives**: Complex implementation details belong in smaller technical sessions

### Meeting Red Flags:
- Agenda items without clear decisions or outcomes
- Meetings scheduled without mandatory pre-work
- Recurring meetings without clear purpose or value assessment
- Attendee lists including roles without clear contribution to objectives

## Policy Evolution

### Quarterly Review Process:
1. Finance Controller analyzes meeting efficiency metrics
2. All roles provide feedback on meeting effectiveness
3. Product Manager proposes policy improvements
4. Role Designer updates protocols based on consensus
5. New version published with 30-day implementation period

### Continuous Improvement Triggers:
- Meeting cost exceeds 2x value delivered (immediate review)
- Decision quality drops below 80% (process audit)
- Attendee satisfaction scores <7/10 (facilitation training)
- Meeting hours increase >20% quarter-over-quarter (efficiency review)
