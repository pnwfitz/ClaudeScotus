# Moore v. Harper

**Docket Number**: 21-1271  
**Term**: 2022-2023  
**Argument Date**: December 7, 2022  
**Decision Date**: June 27, 2023  
**Vote**: 6-3

## Case Overview

A critical case examining the independent state legislature theory in the context of federal elections. The case arose from North Carolina's congressional redistricting process and the state court's rejection of maps drawn by the Republican-controlled legislature.

## Key Legal Issues

- **Independent State Legislature Theory**: Whether state courts can review state legislature actions regarding federal elections
- **Elections Clause**: Interpretation of Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution
- **State Court Authority**: Limits on state court review of election laws
- **Separation of Powers**: Balance between state legislative and judicial power

## Decision

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to reject the independent state legislature theory, affirming that state courts can review state election laws for compliance with state constitutional provisions.

**Majority**: Roberts (author), Sotomayor, Kagan, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Jackson  
**Dissent**: Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch

## Separate Opinions

- **Kavanaugh (concurrence)**: Narrow interpretation focused on judicial review limits
- **Barrett (concurrence)**: Originalist analysis of Elections Clause
- **Thomas (dissent)**: Strong support for independent state legislature theory
- **Alito (dissent)**: Separate dissent on constitutional interpretation

## Significance

This decision rejected a theory that could have dramatically limited state court oversight of federal election laws, maintaining checks and balances in election administration.
