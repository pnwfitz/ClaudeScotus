## Case Overview

A landmark case challenging Harvard's race-conscious admissions program. Students for Fair Admissions argued that Harvard's consideration of race in admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

## Key Legal Issues

- **Equal Protection Clause**: Whether race-conscious admissions programs violate the 14th Amendment
- **Strict Scrutiny**: Application of strict scrutiny to race-based classifications

## Decision

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Harvard's race-conscious admissions program violated the Equal Protection Clause, effectively ending affirmative action in college admissions.

**Majority**: Roberts (author), Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett
