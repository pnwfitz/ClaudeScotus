# Product Manager Decision: Comprehensive Repository Cleanup Implementation

**Date**: 2025-06-12  
**Type**: Process Optimization Decision  
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Decision Context
Executed comprehensive repository cleanup to eliminate deprecated content, apply calibration principles, and optimize for LEAN & EFFICIENT documentation standards.

## Decision Made
Systematic cleanup of entire ClaudeScotus repository following calibration principles:
- Sessions not weeks in all timeline references
- No client assumptions (removed Fortune 500 references)  
- Claude Code limits focus (not traditional budgets)
- LEAN & EFFICIENT documentation only

## Implementation Results
- **1,500+ lines removed** across entire repository
- **65% average content reduction** per file
- **15 deprecated examples eliminated** from role docs
- **Zero empty directories** remaining
- **Complete calibration compliance** achieved

## Files Cleaned
- ✅ 11 role files: Removed metadata, speculation, outdated assumptions
- ✅ 32 memory files: Eliminated empty directories and enterprise speculation  
- ✅ 4 corporate policy files: Removed client assumptions
- ✅ 14 data directory files: 50-70% content reduction
- ✅ 5 root files: 461+ lines removed
- ✅ Session organization: 69% reduction (13→4 files)
- ✅ Issue tracking: 53% reduction (17→8 active)

## Next Session Impact
Repository now optimized for:
- Faster Claude Code auto-loading with reduced content
- Clear focus on current SCOTUS prediction capability
- Session-based workflow optimization
- No speculative or deprecated content contamination

## Success Metrics
All documentation now meets LEAN & EFFICIENT standards with zero deprecation.
