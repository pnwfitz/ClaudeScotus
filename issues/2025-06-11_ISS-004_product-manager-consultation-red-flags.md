# Add consultation red flags section to Product Manager role
**Issue ID**: ISS-004  
**Opened By**: Product Manager  
**Roles Affected**: Product Manager  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Priority**: P3  
**Status**: Open  

## Context  
Role audit revealed that ProductManager.md has consultation framework (lines 102-108) but lacks the explicit "Red Flags (Avoid These)" section that all other roles contain. This creates inconsistency in role guidance and could lead to over-consultation without clear boundaries.

## Impact  
- Inconsistent consultation guidance across role ecosystem
- Potential for inefficient over-consultation without clear boundaries
- Missing guidance on when NOT to involve other roles
- Reduced clarity for role boundaries and decision authority

## Proposed Resolution  
* Add explicit "Red Flags (Avoid These)" subsection to ProductManager.md consultation framework
* Include specific scenarios to avoid over-consultation:
  - Involving technical roles in pure business/strategic decisions
  - Escalating routine project management tasks to leadership
  - Consulting multiple roles for simple prioritization decisions
  - Including too many roles in status update discussions
* Ensure formatting and structure matches other role files
* Maintain consistency with BaseEmployee.md inheritance pattern

## Acceptance Criteria  
- ProductManager.md includes "Red Flags (Avoid These)" section in consultation framework
- Red flags are specific to Product Manager role responsibilities
- Section follows same format/structure as other role files
- No duplicate content with BaseEmployee.md or other roles
- Total consultation framework maintains efficiency focus
- Role audit shows 100% compliance across all roles
