**Completed/Resolved Issues:**
- **ISS-003** - prediction-mvp-scope.md → COMPLETED (MVP scope document created)
- **ISS-007** - enhanced-claude-md-implementation.md → COMPLETED (CLAUDE.md enhanced) 
- **ISS-012** - winddown-command-session-file-timing-bug.md → RESOLVED (timing bug fixed)

**Superseded/Low Priority Issues:**
- **ISS-001** - data-specialist-memory-triggers.md → SUPERSEDED (by ISS-009 memory system optimization)
- **ISS-004** - product-manager-consultation-red-flags.md → LOW PRIORITY P3 (not critical)
- **ISS-006** - docs-style-winddown-refinement.md → SUPERSEDED (by ISS-007 enhanced CLAUDE.md)
- **ISS-013** - product-manager-automatic-ticket-creation-behavior.md → HANDLED IN PRACTICE

### Active Issues Retained (8 issues)
**Current P0/P1 Priorities:**
- **ISS-015** - recursive-improvement-architecture-rollout.md → P0 (actively being worked)
- **ISS-014** - human-name-assignment-rollout.md → P1 (next priority)
- **ISS-002** - pre-commit-hook-enforcement.md → P1 (technical debt)
- **ISS-005** - role-workflow-integration.md → P1 (workflow improvement)
- **ISS-008** - multi-instance-quality-pipeline.md → P1 (quality improvement)

- **ISS-010** - legal-analysis-automation-pipeline.md → P2 (automation enhancement)  
- **ISS-011** - enterprise-cicd-integration.md → P2 (CI/CD integration)

## Results
- **Before**: 17 total issues (noise and completed items)
- **After**: 8 active issues + 7 archived issues
- **Reduction**: 53% fewer active issues to track
- **Focus**: Clear P0/P1 priorities for immediate work
- **Organization**: Completed/superseded work properly archived

## Benefits
✅ **LEAN Compliance**: Active issue tracking only  
✅ **Priority Clarity**: P0/P1 issues clearly visible  
✅ **Context Preservation**: All work history retained in archive  
✅ **Workflow Efficiency**: Reduced cognitive load for issue review  
✅ **Status Accuracy**: Active issues reflect actual work priorities  

## Next Steps
1. Focus on P0 issue ISS-015 (recursive improvement architecture)
2. Complete P1 issue ISS-014 (human name assignment)
3. Address P1 technical debt issues (ISS-002, ISS-005, ISS-008)
4. Consider P2 issues for future sprint planning
