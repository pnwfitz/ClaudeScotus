# SCOTUS Prediction System

An experimental system to predict Supreme Court decisions using LLM-based analysis and prompt engineering.

## Overview

This project attempts to predict SCOTUS rulings by:
1. Analyzing briefs, lower court decisions, and oral arguments
2. Modeling each Justice's judicial philosophy through individual prompts
3. Synthesizing predictions into actionable intelligence for legal teams

## Motivation

Current AI systems struggle with SCOTUS predictions. This project explores whether careful prompt engineering and iterative refinement can do better.

## Approach

- **No coding or legal expertise required** - Built entirely through Claude and prompt engineering
- **Software engineering practices** - Using PM, architect, and code review roles to structure development
- **Individual Justice modeling** - 9 separate models for each Justice + 1 synthesis model
- **Historical training** - Analyzing cases from Justice Jackson's confirmation through present
- **Practical output** - Formatted as law firm partner briefings to Fortune 500 general counsel

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development** - Setting up initial repository structure and role-based prompts

## Project Structure

```
/prompts     - Role-based prompts for development and analysis
/docs        - Documentation and design decisions
/analysis    - Case analysis and Justice models (coming soon)
/data        - Case briefs and decisions (coming soon)
```

## Goals

- Achieve 80% prediction accuracy with 80% confidence intervals
- Create maintainable system that improves with each case
- Build something useful for legal professionals without legal training

## Method

Using Claude Code and iterative prompt refinement. No traditional coding required.
