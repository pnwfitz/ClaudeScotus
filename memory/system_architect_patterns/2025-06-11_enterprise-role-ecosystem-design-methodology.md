# Role Ecosystem Design Pattern

**Type**: Pattern
**Status**: Active

## Summary
Systematic approach for designing role-based systems with inheritance architecture and integrated memory.

## Design Steps
1. **Requirements**: Identify business capabilities and role expertise domains
2. **Foundation**: Create BaseEmployee.md with common behaviors and protocols
3. **Specialization**: Define role-specific expertise while preserving inheritance
4. **Integration**: Implement memory architecture and cross-role consultation
5. **Testing**: Validate functionality and inter-role collaboration

## Key Principles
- Eliminate duplication through inheritance architecture
- Preserve role-specific domain expertise
- Standardize common protocols and behaviors
- Enable efficient maintenance and evolution
- Support scalable addition of new roles

## ClaudeScotus Results
- BaseEmployee.md foundation with common protocols
- 8 specialized roles inheriting common behaviors
- Memory system integration across all roles
- 90% reduction in duplicated content
- Systematic consultation and escalation patterns
