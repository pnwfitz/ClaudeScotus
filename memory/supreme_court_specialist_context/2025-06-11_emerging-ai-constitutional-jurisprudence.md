# AI Constitutional Context

**Type**: Context
**Status**: Active

## Summary
Supreme Court has limited AI precedent, requiring application of analogous constitutional frameworks to novel AI circumstances.

## Current Landscape
- **No direct SCOTUS AI precedent**: Limited guidance from federal courts
- **Analogous frameworks**: Corporate personhood, digital privacy, due process precedents
- **Circuit divergence**: Different approaches creating potential cert opportunities

## Key Constitutional Areas
1. **AI Rights**: Whether AI systems can possess constitutional protections
2. **Government AI Use**: Due process requirements for AI-assisted decisions
3. **Private AI Regulation**: Commerce Clause and First Amendment limits
4. **Fundamental Rights**: Privacy, voting, religious liberty implications
