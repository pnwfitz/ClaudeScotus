## Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Data Collection
**Objective**: Collect and organize Supreme Court case materials for the last two terms

**Key Components**:
- `data/terms/2022-2023/` - Complete case files for 2022-2023 term
- `data/terms/2023-2024/` - Complete case files for 2023-2024 term
- Standardized case folder structure for each case
- Term summary documents

**Case Structure** (per case):
```
cases/[case-name]/
├── metadata.json           # Case identifiers, dates, parties
├── briefs/                # Petitioner and respondent briefs
├── opinions/              # Majority, concurring, dissenting opinions
├── oral_arguments/        # Transcripts and audio (if available)
└── README.md              # Case overview and key information
```

### Phase 2: Analysis & Documentation
**Objective**: Create comprehensive justice profiles and court meta-analysis

**Key Components**:
- `data/analysis/justices/` - Individual justice behavioral profiles
- `data/analysis/court-meta/` - Court dynamics and coalition analysis
- Predictive framework based on historical patterns
- Quality validation and confidence scoring

**Justice Profile Structure**:
```
justices/[justice-name].md
├── Voting Patterns        # Historical voting behavior
├── Judicial Philosophy    # Constitutional interpretation approach
├── Key Opinions          # Significant majority/dissenting opinions
├── Coalition Behavior    # Alignment with other justices
└── Prediction Factors    # Key indicators for future votes
```

**Court Meta-Analysis**:
```
court-meta/
├── coalition-analysis.md  # Justice alignment patterns
├── ideological-trends.md  # Court's ideological evolution
├── case-type-patterns.md  # Outcomes by legal domain
└── prediction-framework.md # Methodology for outcome prediction
```

## Data Sources

**Primary Sources**:
- Supreme Court official website (supremecourt.gov)
- CourtListener API for case metadata
- Legal databases for brief and opinion text
- Oral argument transcripts from official sources

**Data Quality Standards**:
- All sources must be official or legally authoritative
- Complete case records (no partial data)
- Consistent formatting and metadata
- Version control for all updates

## Technical Architecture

**Core Tools**:
- Claude Code for file operations and analysis
- Git for version control and collaboration
- Markdown for documentation and analysis
- JSON for structured metadata

**Workflow**:
1. Data collection using web scraping and API calls
2. Standardized file organization and metadata creation
3. Systematic analysis using legal expertise
4. Documentation in searchable, structured format
5. Version control and quality assurance

## Quality Assurance

**Data Validation**:
- Verify all case citations and legal references
- Cross-check facts against multiple sources
- Maintain audit trail for all data sources
- Regular validation of analysis accuracy

**Analysis Standards**:
- Document all assumptions and limitations
- Provide confidence levels for predictions
- Maintain reproducible methodology
- Regular review and validation of conclusions

## Success Metrics

**Phase 1**:
- Complete case files for both target terms
- Consistent data structure across all cases
- Comprehensive metadata for searchability

**Phase 2**:
- Individual justice profiles for all 9 current justices
- Court meta-analysis covering major patterns
- Prediction framework with validation methodology
- Quality documentation for all analysis

## Future Considerations

**Scalability**:
- Structure supports adding additional terms
- Modular analysis framework for new justices
- API-ready data structure for external integrations

**Analysis Enhancement**:
- Machine learning integration for pattern detection
- Quantitative analysis of voting patterns
- Predictive modeling for case outcomes
- Historical trend analysis across multiple terms
