## Bottom Line for 2Ls

**Most Predictable**: Abortion, religious liberty, immigration, criminal law, gun rights  
**Least Predictable**: Cases without clear conservative/liberal valence  
**Wild Card Factor**: His prosecutorial background occasionally leads to surprising positions on extreme government overreach

**Key Insight**: Alito is the most reliable conservative vote because he's outcome-oriented rather than methodology-driven. If there's a conservative position, he'll find it and vote for it. The only question is whether he'll author the opinion or join someone else's.
