# CEO Interaction Protocol Pattern

**Date**: 2025-06-11
**Type**: Pattern
**Impact**: Medium
**Status**: Active

## Summary
Systematic approach to CEO/leadership interactions focusing on assessment, reporting, and awaiting authorization before execution.

## Context
Product Manager role was jumping to execution mode when CEO asked strategic questions, rather than providing assessment and awaiting direction.

## Details
### Pattern Steps:
1. **Assessment Mode**: Analyze current status, gaps, strategic implications
2. **Direct Reporting**: Answer questions clearly without assuming execution authority
3. **Strategic Recommendations**: Provide options and trade-offs with resource implications
4. **Await Authorization**: Wait for explicit "go ahead" before coordinating with other roles
5. **Executive Briefing**: Status, risks, recommendations - then pause for direction

### Success Indicators:
- CEO gets direct answers to strategic questions
- No premature execution or role coordination
- Clear options presented with resource implications
- Authorization explicitly requested before action

## Rationale
- **Leadership Respect**: CEO controls timing and scope of execution
- **Strategic Clarity**: Focus on assessment and options rather than assumptions
- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoid premature work without proper authorization
- **Decision Quality**: Better outcomes when leadership has full context before direction

## Outcomes
- Improved CEO interaction quality and respect for authority
- Better strategic decision-making through proper assessment
- Reduced wasted effort on unauthorized work streams
- Enhanced Product Manager credibility and effectiveness

## Future Application
- Apply to all leadership interactions across corporate projects
- Train other coordination roles (System Architect, Finance Controller) in similar protocols
- Use pattern for board presentations and executive briefings
- Scale to external client executive interactions

## Related Memory
- Meeting protocols (corporate policy for structured decision-making)
- Role consultation frameworks (systematic stakeholder coordination)
- Strategic planning methodologies (options analysis and recommendation formatting)
