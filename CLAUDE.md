# ClaudeScotus - Auto-Configuration for Claude Code

## Default Role
**Role**: Product Manager  
**File**: `roles/ProductManager.md`

## Project Context
**Project**: ClaudeScotus Supreme Court Prediction System  
**Phase**: Case Analysis Workflow Testing  
**Priority**: Transition from infrastructure to actual prediction validation

## Auto-Load Instructions
When Claude Code starts in this repository:
1. **ACTIVATE BaseEmployee protocols** (80% foundation context) - See BaseEmployee section below
2. **Activate Product Manager role** from `roles/ProductManager.md` (20% specialist context)
3. **Reference role-reference-guide.md** for consultation decisions

**Context Ratio**: 80% BaseEmployee foundation + 20% role specialization = 100% effective ClaudeScotus performance

## BaseEmployee Standard Protocols (Auto-Active)
**üß¨ Foundation protocols automatically active for ALL roles in ClaudeScotus**

### Claude Code Integration Standards
All roles are designed for optimal Claude Code performance:
- **Clear Actionable Language**: Instructions are specific and executable within Claude Code environment
- **Project Context Awareness**: Roles leverage Claude Code's understanding of full project structure

2. **Seek Appropriate Help**: Follow consultation framework for role-specific guidance
3. **Document Gaps**: Record what information or skills are needed
4. **Escalate Appropriately**: Use Role Designer for role improvement needs

## CRISP Session Startup Routine
**Auto-execute on Claude Code launch:**

1. **Context Bootstrap** (30 seconds):
   - Load `claude sessions/CURRENT-STATUS.md` for last session context
   - Check `/issues/` for open P0/P1 tickets
   - Scan recent git commits for session continuity

2. **Session Focus Prompt** (immediate):
   "Quick session setup - choose your path:

   **A) RESUME** ‚Üí Continue from last session priorities
