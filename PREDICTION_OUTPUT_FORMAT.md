## Confidence Calibration

### Confidence Levels
- **High (80-95%)**: Strong alignment with justice's established patterns
- **Medium (60-79%)**: Probable outcome with some uncertainty
- **Low (40-59%)**: Significant uncertainty, could go either way
- **Very Low (<40%)**: Highly unpredictable, insufficient information

### Calibration Standards
- Confidence levels should reflect actual prediction accuracy over time
- High confidence predictions should be correct 80-95% of the time
- Medium confidence predictions should be correct 60-79% of the time
- Track and adjust confidence calibration based on historical performance

## Integration with Prediction Process

### Sub-Agent Output
Each justice-specific sub-agent produces one individual prediction file using this template.

### Aggregation Process
Master summary combines all 9 individual predictions into consolidated case analysis.

### Quality Assurance
- Validate that all predictions use standardized format
- Check mathematical consistency of coalition predictions
- Ensure confidence levels are realistic and calibrated
- Verify reasoning aligns with justice profiles
