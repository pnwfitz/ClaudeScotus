# SCOTUS Prediction System

An experimental system to predict Supreme Court decisions using LLM-based analysis and role-based prompt engineering.

## Claude Code Configuration

**Default Role**: Product Manager  
When starting Claude Code sessions in this repository, automatically activate the Product Manager role for project coordination and stakeholder alignment.

```bash
# Auto-load command for Claude Code
claude --role="ProductManager" --context="ClaudeScotus"
```

## Overview

This project predicts SCOTUS rulings through:
1. **Legal Analysis**: Supreme Court Specialist analyzes briefs, decisions, and oral arguments
2. **Justice Modeling**: Individual Justice-specific prediction models
3. **Strategic Synthesis**: Law Partner transforms analysis into Fortune 500 executive briefings
4. **System Architecture**: Full software engineering practices using role-based development

## Project Status

âœ… **Architecture Complete** - Role-based system with BaseEmployee.md inheritance  
âœ… **Role Ecosystem** - 9 specialized roles with organizational reference guide  
ðŸŽ¯ **Next Phase** - Case analysis workflow testing and prediction validation

## Methodology

### Text-Based System Design
- **No databases**: Simple file-based organization
- **Prompt engineering**: Iterative role refinement and optimization  
- **Git workflows**: Version control for roles, analysis, and documentation
- **Session continuity**: Complete documentation for context preservation

### Prediction Workflow
1. **Case Intake**: Supreme Court Specialist analyzes legal materials
2. **Justice Modeling**: Individual Justice prediction analysis
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Systematic uncertainty quantification
4. **Strategic Synthesis**: Law Partner creates executive briefings
5. **Validation**: Historical case testing and accuracy measurement

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Objectives
- **80% prediction accuracy** with proper confidence calibration
- **Fortune 500 utility** - actionable intelligence for corporate legal teams
- **System maintainability** - sustainable role-based architecture

### Quality Standards
- **Professional output**: Law firm partner-quality briefings
- **Transparent uncertainty**: Clear confidence intervals and limitations
- **Iterative improvement**: Learning from each case analysis

## Getting Started

### For New Users
1. **Start with Product Manager role** (auto-loads by default)
2. **Review role reference guide**: `corporate policy/role-reference-guide.md`
3. **Check recent sessions**: `claude sessions/` for current context
4. **Follow meeting protocols**: Efficient consultation and decision-making

### For Case Analysis
1. **Activate Supreme Court Specialist** for legal research and analysis
2. **Use Law Partner** for strategic synthesis and client deliverables
