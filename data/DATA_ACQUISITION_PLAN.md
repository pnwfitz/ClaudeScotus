# Data Acquisition Plan

## Objective
Populate 2022-2024 Supreme Court term data for prediction validation

## Data Sources Strategy

### Primary Sources
1. **Supreme Court Website** (supremecourt.gov)
   - Official opinions, transcripts, briefs
   - Most reliable but limited historical depth
   - Free access, high quality PDFs

2. **Justia Supreme Court Center** (supreme.justia.com)
   - Comprehensive case archive
   - Good search and organization
   - Free access, consistent formatting

3. **Google Scholar** (scholar.google.com)
   - Case law search and citation analysis
   - Good for finding related cases
   - Free but less systematic organization

4. **Oyez Project** (oyez.org)
   - Oral argument audio and analysis
   - Excellent for argument transcripts
   - Educational focus, amateur-friendly

### Additional Sources
1. **SCOTUSblog** - Case tracking and analysis

## Data Collection Workflow

### Phase 1: Case Inventory
- Identify all cases for each term
- Categorize by legal area
- Priority ranking for prediction value

### Phase 2: Document Acquisition
**Priority Order**: 
1. High-value cases (constitutional law, major precedent impact)
2. Prediction test cases (clear ideological splits)
3. Complete term coverage

**Document Structure**:
```
[docket-number]_[case-name]/
├── README.md
├── briefs/
├── oral_arguments/
├── opinions/
└── metadata.json
```

### Phase 3: Metadata Creation
```json
{
  "docket_number": "22-123",
  "case_name": "Example v. Case",
  "decision_date": "2023-06-15",
  "vote_breakdown": {
    "majority": ["Roberts", "Thomas", "Alito"],
    "dissent": ["Sotomayor", "Kagan", "Jackson"]
  },
  "legal_areas": ["Constitutional Law"]
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Automated Collection Tools
1. **Web Scraping Scripts** (Python/Selenium)
   - Systematic download from public sources
   - Consistent file naming and organization
   - Error handling and retry logic

2. **Document Processing Pipeline**
   - PDF text extraction for analysis
   - Metadata extraction and standardization
   - Quality validation and completeness checking

### Manual Curation Requirements
1. **Case Selection** - Legal team identifies prediction-valuable cases
2. **Quality Review** - Law Partner validates case summaries
3. **Amateur Testing** - Verify navigation and accessibility

## Resource Requirements

### Roles
- Data Specialist: Collection automation
- Supreme Court Specialist: Case analysis
- System Architect: Technical infrastructure

### Storage
