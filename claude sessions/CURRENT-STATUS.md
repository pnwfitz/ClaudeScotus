# ClaudeScotus Session Handoff

## Last Session Summary
**Role**: Product Manager  
**Date**: 2025-06-12  
**Focus**: Comprehensive repository cleanup - LEAN & EFFICIENT documentation achieved

## Next Session Priorities
1. **P0**: Complete ISS-015 - Maya Chen rollout recursive improvement architecture to remaining specialist roles
2. **P1**: Begin SCOTUS case data acquisition using validated CourtListener API approach  
3. **P1**: Maya assigns human names to all remaining roles (ISS-014) - User experience enhancement

## Context Needed
- **Role**: Maya Chen (Role Designer) for ISS-015 architecture rollout completion or Data Specialist for case acquisition
- **Files**: Repository now optimized - BaseEmployee protocols guaranteed via CLAUDE.md, 4 specialist roles need 80/20 updates
- **Issues**: ISS-015 (recursive improvement), ISS-014 (human names), active case acquisition work

## Quick Resume
"Repository transformation complete - 1,500+ lines of deprecated content removed, all docs now LEAN & EFFICIENT. Ready for productive SCOTUS prediction development with optimized session performance."

## Work Ready to Continue
- ✅ All role files analyzed and implementation pattern established
- ✅ ProductManager.md transformation serves as template for all specialist roles
- ✅ Maya Chen LLM optimization methodology fully documented
- ✅ Zero work lost from context compact interruption
- ✅ Emergency winddown protocols successfully executed
- ✅ All commits pushed to remote repository

## Architecture Status
- ✅ ProductManager completely transformed to prompt orchestration router
- ✅ Maya Chen established as LLM context optimization specialist  
- ✅ Human naming system foundation created (8 roles pending name assignment)
- ✅ Error-to-ticket pipeline for recursive improvement implemented
- ✅ 5-step workflow: Context switch → Generate → Route to Maya → Optimize → Save
- ✅ Text-as-prompt awareness in core roles, ready for specialist role deployment

## Technical Notes
- CourtListener REST API v4 validated and working for data acquisition
- All infrastructure in place for systematic prompt optimization toward SCOTUS prediction accuracy
- Role ecosystem ready for complete recursive improvement implementation
- Maya Chen identity successfully integrated with comprehensive LLM optimization workflow
- Context compact interruption management procedures documented for future reference
