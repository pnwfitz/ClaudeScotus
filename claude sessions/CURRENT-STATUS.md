# ClaudeScotus Session Handoff

## Last Session Summary
**Role**: Maya Chen (Role Designer)  
**Date**: 2025-06-11  
**Focus**: Emergency winddown after context compact interruption during ISS-015 rollout

## Next Session Priorities
1. **P0**: Complete ISS-015 - Maya Chen to rollout recursive improvement architecture to all 8 specialist roles
2. **P1**: Maya assigns human names to all remaining roles (ISS-014) - User experience enhancement  
3. **P1**: Begin SCOTUS case data acquisition using validated CourtListener API approach

## Context Needed
- **Role**: Maya Chen (Role Designer) for ISS-015 architecture rollout completion
- **Files**: All 8 specialist role definitions need recursive improvement updates (LawPartner, FinanceController, SupremeCourtSpecialist, DataSpecialist, SystemArchitect, StaffEngineer, FullStackEngineer)
- **Issues**: ISS-014 (human names), ISS-015 (recursive improvement rollout)

## Quick Resume
"Context compact recovery complete. Maya Chen ready to implement ISS-015 recursive improvement architecture in all 8 specialist roles with LLM optimization awareness, error-to-ticket pipeline, and workflow routing established."

## Work Ready to Continue
- ✅ All role files analyzed and implementation pattern established
- ✅ ProductManager.md transformation serves as template for all specialist roles
- ✅ Maya Chen LLM optimization methodology fully documented
- ✅ Zero work lost from context compact interruption
- ✅ Emergency winddown protocols successfully executed
- ✅ All commits pushed to remote repository

## Architecture Status
- ✅ ProductManager completely transformed to prompt orchestration router
- ✅ Maya Chen established as LLM context optimization specialist  
- ✅ Human naming system foundation created (8 roles pending name assignment)
- ✅ Error-to-ticket pipeline for recursive improvement implemented
- ✅ 5-step workflow: Context switch → Generate → Route to Maya → Optimize → Save
- ✅ Text-as-prompt awareness in core roles, ready for specialist role deployment

## Technical Notes
- CourtListener REST API v4 validated and working for data acquisition
- All infrastructure in place for systematic prompt optimization toward SCOTUS prediction accuracy
- Role ecosystem ready for complete recursive improvement implementation
- Maya Chen identity successfully integrated with comprehensive LLM optimization workflow
- Context compact interruption management procedures documented for future reference
