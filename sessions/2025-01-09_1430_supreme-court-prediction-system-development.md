# Session Summary - Supreme Court Prediction System Development

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Time**: 1430  
**Focus**: Complete ClaudeScotus prediction system architecture and development roadmap

## Work Completed

### Justice Prediction Profiles (9 Complete)
- **Conservative Justices**: Roberts (institutionalist), Thomas (originalist), Alito (results-oriented), Gorsuch (libertarian textualist), Kavanaugh (incrementalist), Barrett (academic originalist)
- **Liberal Justices**: Sotomayor (empathetic), Kagan (strategic), Jackson (progressive with criminal justice focus)
- Each profile includes detailed judicial philosophy, voting patterns, case area predictions, and practical checklists

### Framework Documentation (4 Documents)
- **CASE_DOCUMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md**: 8-document collection checklist for each case
- **CASE_METADATA_FRAMEWORK.md**: "Nice to have" metadata for enhanced predictions
- **PREDICTION_PROCESS_FRAMEWORK.md**: 9 sub-agent parallel processing architecture
- **PREDICTION_OUTPUT_FORMAT.md**: Standardized prediction output templates

### Project Structure
- **PROJECT_ROADMAP.md**: Complete 4-phase development plan with 18 tracked tasks
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Simplified Phase 1 (data collection) and Phase 2 (analysis) structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Single unified role combining legal expertise, PM, and prompt engineering
- **README.md**: Updated project overview reflecting new architecture

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Simplification
- Eliminated complex multi-role corporate persona system
- Created single unified role for all prompts
- Focused on two-phase structure: data collection â†’ analysis
- Removed obsolete files and directories from old system

### Prediction System Design
- 9 parallel sub-agents, each representing one justice's decision-making approach
- Standardized data ingestion: court documents + justice profiles + metadata
- Comprehensive output format with confidence levels and coalition analysis
- Iterative improvement process based on actual outcome validation

### Development Approach
- Start with single case testing for proof of concept
- Full term analysis on 2022-2023 data with accuracy validation
- Profile updates based on prediction accuracy
- Final validation on 2024-2025 out-of-training data

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 1)
1. **Research data sources** for Supreme Court documents and case information
2. **Implement data collection system** with validation and quality checks
3. **Test complete prediction system** on single case from start to finish

### Medium-term Goals (Phase 2)
1. **Collect 2022-2023 term documents** for full-scale analysis
2. **Implement 9 sub-agent prediction system** following framework
3. **Run prediction analysis** and validate against actual outcomes

### Long-term Objectives (Phases 3-4)
1. **Iterative improvement** based on prediction accuracy analysis
2. **Final system validation** on out-of-training data
3. **80%+ prediction accuracy** target achievement
