# Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh - Prediction Profile

**Appointed**: October 2018 by President Trump  
**Confirmation Vote**: 50-48 (highly contentious)  
**Age at Appointment**: 53  
**Background**: D.C. Circuit Judge, Bush White House Staff Secretary, Kenneth Starr deputy  
**Tenure**: 6+ years (replaced Kennedy)

## Judicial Philosophy

**Core Principle**: **Incrementalist Conservative**  
Kavanaugh represents the establishment conservative approach - reliably conservative outcomes achieved through gradual, precedent-respectful methods rather than revolutionary change.

**Key Philosophical Elements**:
- **Precedent Respect**: Reluctant to overturn established precedent without compelling justification
- **Incremental Change**: Prefers step-by-step conservative advancement over dramatic reversals
- **Institutional Awareness**: Concerned about Court's public legitimacy and political standing
- **Executive Power**: Pro-executive authority but more restrained than Bush-era positions
- **Consensus Building**: Seeks narrow rulings that avoid broad constitutional pronouncements

## Voting Patterns & Predictive Framework

### Conservative Reliability (80% of cases)
Kavanaugh is reliably conservative but less predictable than Thomas/Alito, more so than Roberts/Gorsuch.

**Reliable Conservative Votes**:
- **Business Regulation**: Consistently pro-business, anti-regulatory
- **Gun Rights**: Strong Second Amendment supporter
- **Religious Liberty**: Conservative on free exercise, careful on establishment
- **Criminal Law**: Generally pro-prosecution but concerned about overreach
- **Property Rights**: Strong protection against government taking

### Moderate Positions (15-20% of cases)
Kavanaugh seeks middle ground when conservative coalition might go too far:
- **Abortion**: Post-Dobbs supports restrictions but may limit scope
- **Immigration**: Conservative instincts tempered by humanitarian concerns
- **Voting Rights**: Conservative on access but concerned about democracy legitimacy
- **Administrative Law**: Skeptical of agencies but respects clear congressional delegation

## Key Case Areas for Prediction

### Abortion Rights
**Pattern**: **Conservative but Cautious**  
**Key Cases**: Joined Dobbs majority but signaled concern about further restrictions  
**Reasoning**: Willing to overturn Roe but wants gradual approach to restrictions  
**Prediction Factor**: Will support abortion restrictions but may resist most extreme regulations

### Business/Economic Law
**Pattern**: **Reliably Conservative**  
**Key Cases**: Consistently pro-business in regulatory and litigation contexts  
**Reasoning**: Skeptical of government regulation and sympathetic to business interests  
**Prediction Factor**: Will vote for business interests in virtually all cases

### Religious Liberty
**Pattern**: **Conservative with Balance**  
**Key Cases**: Supports free exercise but concerned about establishment clause  
**Reasoning**: Religious liberty important but must be balanced with other constitutional values  
**Prediction Factor**: Will vote for religious liberty claims but may impose some limits

### Criminal Law
**Pattern**: **Moderate Conservative**  
**Key Cases**: Generally pro-prosecution but concerned about prosecutorial overreach  
**Reasoning**: Law and order important but due process must be respected  
**Prediction Factor**: Will vote for prosecution in most cases but may join liberals on extreme overreach

### Administrative Law
**Pattern**: **Skeptical but Respectful**  
**Key Cases**: Questions agency authority but respects clear congressional delegation  
**Reasoning**: Agencies should stay within statutory bounds but Congress can delegate clearly  
**Prediction Factor**: Will limit agency power but won't dismantle administrative state

### Executive Power
**Pattern**: **Pro-Executive but Restrained**  
**Key Cases**: Supports presidential authority but less expansively than Bush-era positions  
**Reasoning**: Executive needs authority to function but within constitutional limits  
**Prediction Factor**: Will support executive power claims but may impose some constraints

## Prediction Methodology

### High Confidence Conservative Vote (85%+)
- **Business regulation** challenges
- **Gun rights** expansions or protections
- **Religious liberty** free exercise claims
- **Property rights** against government taking
- **Criminal law** cases favoring prosecution (routine cases)

### Moderate Confidence Conservative Vote (70-85%)
- **Abortion** restrictions (but may limit scope)
- **Administrative law** agency limitations
- **Voting rights** restrictions
- **Immigration** enforcement measures
- **Executive power** claims

### Swing Vote Possibility (50-70%)
- **Extreme abortion** restrictions
- **Voting rights** in highly partisan contexts
- **Immigration** with humanitarian concerns
- **Criminal law** with prosecutorial overreach
- **Administrative law** with clear congressional delegation

### Potential Liberal Vote (15-30%)
- **Extreme prosecutorial overreach**
- **Clear due process violations**
- **Voting rights** threats to democracy
- **Immigration** humanitarian cases
- **First Amendment** government censorship

## Strategic Considerations

**Precedent Anchor**: Kavanaugh's respect for precedent creates some unpredictability in revolutionary cases where other conservatives might overturn established law.

**Consensus Builder**: Often writes narrower majorities that attract broader support, potentially limiting scope of conservative victories.

**Institutional Concerns**: Worry about Court's legitimacy may cause him to moderate conservative positions in highly visible cases.

**Confirmation Effects**: Contentious confirmation hearings may have made him more cautious about appearing overly partisan.

When analyzing Kavanaugh's likely vote:

**Strong Conservative Indicators**:
- [ ] Business regulation challenges

**Moderate Conservative Indicators**:
- [ ] Abortion restrictions (gradual approach)
- [ ] Administrative law limitations

- [ ] Voting rights restrictions

**Potential Swing Vote Factors**:
- [ ] Extreme conservative positions
- [ ] Threat to Court's institutional legitimacy
- [ ] Clear precedent supporting liberal position
- [ ] Prosecutorial overreach concerns
- [ ] Humanitarian immigration issues

**Precedent Analysis Required**:
- [ ] Is there clear precedent supporting one side?
- [ ] Would conservative outcome require overturning established law?

- [ ] Would liberal outcome respect institutional stability?

## Bottom Line for 2Ls

Kavanaugh is a **reliable but moderate conservative** who achieves conservative outcomes through incremental, precedent-respectful methods. He's less predictable than Thomas/Alito because he genuinely cares about precedent and institutional legitimacy.

**Most Predictable**: Business law, gun rights, routine religious liberty, standard criminal law  
**Least Predictable**: Extreme conservative positions, cases requiring major precedent overturning, highly partisan voting rights  
**Wild Card Factor**: His respect for precedent and institutional concerns can moderate conservative outcomes

**Key Insight**: Kavanaugh asks "How can we reach a conservative outcome without appearing too partisan or overturning too much precedent?" This makes him more moderate than other conservatives but still reliably conservative in outcome.
