# Add self-improvement memory triggers to Data Specialist
**Issue ID**: ISS-001  
**Opened By**: Product Manager  
**Roles Affected**: Data Specialist  
**Type**: Memory  
**Priority**: P2  
**Status**: Open  

## Context  
The Data Specialist role currently lacks explicit memory-update triggers for systematic learning and improvement. Without these triggers, valuable insights from case analysis, data processing patterns, and research methodologies are not being captured in the role's memory system.

## Impact  
- Lost institutional knowledge from data analysis sessions
- Reduced efficiency from repeated discovery of the same insights
- Inability to track data quality patterns and processing improvements
- Missing systematic learning that could improve Supreme Court prediction accuracy

## Proposed Resolution  
* Add explicit memory-update triggers to Data Specialist role file
* Define specific scenarios requiring memory documentation:
  - Novel data source discoveries
  - Data quality issue patterns
  - Processing methodology improvements
  - Research finding validation patterns
* Ensure triggers align with BaseEmployee.md inheritance structure
* Test triggers with a sample case analysis session

## Acceptance Criteria  
- Data Specialist role file contains explicit memory-update triggers section
- Triggers cover data discovery, quality, methodology, and validation scenarios
- Memory triggers follow BaseEmployee.md conventions
- Test session demonstrates trigger activation and memory documentation
- Memory file created demonstrates proper structure and content
