# Claude Sessions Documentation

This folder contains complete transcripts of Claude Code sessions working on the ClaudeScotus project.

## Purpose
- **Historical record** of how roles were created and evolved
- **Learning archive** for understanding what worked/failed in role design
- **Context preservation** for future development sessions
- **Process documentation** for iterative prompt engineering

## Naming Convention
`YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_session-description.md`

## Session Types
- **Role Design**: Creating or modifying project roles
- **Analysis**: Case analysis and prediction work
- **Development**: Technical infrastructure and workflow
- **Review**: Quality assurance and role evaluation

## Documentation Standards
Each session file should include:
- Date and start time
- Session objectives
- Key deliverables (with checkboxes)
- Major decisions or insights
- Full conversation transcript
- Outcomes and next steps

## Git Integration
- Each session should be committed as a complete unit
- Session files provide context for other project changes
- Useful for tracking the evolution of the role-based system

## Usage Notes
- These sessions are working documents, not polished documentation
- They capture the iterative process of role refinement
- Failures and corrections are documented for learning
- Sessions may reference each other chronologically
