# ClaudeScotus Session Handoff

## Last Session Summary
**Role**: Maya Chen (Role Designer)  
**Date**: 2025-06-11  
**Focus**: Recursive improvement architecture transformation - complete role ecosystem overhaul

## Next Session Priorities
1. **P0**: Complete recursive improvement rollout to all 8 specialist roles (ISS-015) - Architecture completion
2. **P1**: Maya assigns human names to all remaining roles (ISS-014) - User experience enhancement  
3. **P1**: Begin SCOTUS case data acquisition using validated CourtListener API approach

## Context Needed
- **Role**: Maya Chen (Role Designer) for ISS-015 architecture rollout, or Product Manager for data acquisition coordination
- **Files**: All 8 specialist role definitions need recursive improvement updates
- **Issues**: ISS-014 (human names), ISS-015 (recursive improvement), pending data acquisition

## Quick Resume
"Recursive improvement architecture successfully implemented in PM and RD. Now need Maya to rollout the same LLM optimization awareness to all 8 specialist roles so they generate outputs that route through optimization workflow toward 80% SCOTUS accuracy."

## Session Achievements
- ✅ ProductManager completely transformed to prompt orchestration router
- ✅ Maya Chen established as LLM context optimization specialist  
- ✅ Human naming system foundation created
- ✅ Error-to-ticket pipeline for recursive improvement implemented
- ✅ 5-step workflow: Context switch → Generate → Route to Maya → Optimize → Save
- ✅ Text-as-prompt awareness throughout system

## Technical Notes
- CourtListener REST API v4 validated and working for data acquisition
- Complete role ecosystem ready for recursive improvement implementation
- All infrastructure in place for systematic prompt optimization toward SCOTUS prediction accuracy
- Maya Chen identity successfully integrated with comprehensive LLM optimization workflow
