### ‚ùå **Meeting Over-Inclusion**

- Including domain experts in meetings outside their expertise
- Comprehensive consultation when selective consultation works
- Technical roles in strategic planning without technical component

### ‚ùå **Under-Consultation**
- Making legal strategy decisions without Law Partner
- Technical architecture decisions without System Architect
- Budget/resource decisions without Finance Controller
- Role design changes without Role Designer

## Efficiency Optimization Tips

### ‚ö° **Start Small**
1. **Begin with primary role** for your domain
2. **Check if decision requires consultation** (see role-specific frameworks)
3. **Use async documentation** before meetings when possible
4. **Follow meeting protocols** for required attendees

### ‚ö° **Role Handoffs**
- **Document context clearly** when passing work between roles
- **Include relevant memory/history** for role bootstrap
- **Specify expected deliverables** and quality standards
- **Set clear deadlines** and communication expectations

### ‚ö° **Consultation Decision**
Each role has specific consultation frameworks in their role definitions. Default pattern:
1. **Use role expertise first** - most questions can be answered within role scope
2. **Consult minimally** - only involve roles directly needed for decision
3. **Follow meeting protocols** - use established meeting types for structured decisions
4. **Document decisions** - preserve context for future reference
