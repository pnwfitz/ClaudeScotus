# Integrate issue tracking into role daily workflows
**Issue ID**: ISS-005  
**Opened By**: Product Manager  
**Roles Affected**: All roles  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Priority**: P1  
**Status**: Open  

## Context  
Issue tracking system is functional but roles lack explicit guidance on session startup routines, issue checking workflows, and self-assignment protocols. Currently there's no systematic way for roles to discover assigned work or integrate issue management into daily activities.

## Impact  
- Issues created but not systematically worked on
- Roles start sessions without awareness of assigned tickets
- No clear workflow for issue discovery, assignment, and status updates
- Missing integration between issue system and actual work patterns
- Session startup lacks structured approach to work prioritization

## Proposed Resolution  
* Add explicit session startup routine to all role files:
  - Check assigned issues before starting new work
  - Review issue status and update progress
  - Prioritize assigned work vs new requests
* Clarify self-assignment protocols:
  - When roles can assign themselves vs wait for PM triage
  - How to handle urgent issues vs normal workflow
* Integrate issue creation into consultation frameworks:
  - When to create issues during work sessions
  - How to properly scope and document work items
* Add issue status update triggers to work completion routines
* Update CLAUDE.md with session startup checklist including issue review

## Acceptance Criteria  
- All role files include explicit session startup issue checking routine
- Clear guidance on self-assignment vs PM assignment protocols
- Issue creation integrated into consultation and work workflows
- CLAUDE.md updated with session startup procedure including issue review
- Role memory triggers include issue status updates
- Test session demonstrates smooth issue discovery and work prioritization
