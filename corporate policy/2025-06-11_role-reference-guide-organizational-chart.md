## Session Handoff Guidelines

### 🟢 **Primary Session Patterns**
- **SCOTUS Analysis**: Supreme Court Specialist → Law Partner validation
- **Technical Implementation**: System Architect → Staff Engineer → Full-Stack Engineer
- **Data Processing**: Data Specialist → Supreme Court Specialist analysis
- **Session Coordination**: Product Manager orchestration with role-specific handoffs

### 🟡 **Secondary Coordination**
- **Finance Controller**: Session efficiency analysis and workflow optimization
- **Role Designer**: When session patterns need optimization or role improvements
- **Cross-validation**: Multiple Claude instances for critical prediction validation

### 🔴 **Avoid Session Mixing**
- **Technical roles**: In pure legal analysis sessions
- **Legal roles**: In pure technical implementation sessions
- **Coordination roles**: In domain-specific deep work sessions

## Session Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ **Wrong Role Activation**
- Using Supreme Court Specialist for technical implementation
- Using Product Manager for detailed legal analysis
- Using Finance Controller for case analysis or coding
- Using System Architect for routine implementation tasks

### ❌ **Session Scope Confusion**
- Mixing legal analysis with technical implementation in single session
- Using wrong role expertise for task domain
- Attempting comprehensive analysis when focused expertise needed
- Context switching without proper handoff documentation

### ❌ **Missing Validation**
- SCOTUS predictions without Law Partner accuracy validation
- Technical architecture without System Architect review
- Session efficiency issues without Finance Controller analysis
- Role performance problems without Role Designer consultation

---

## Session Efficiency Optimization

### ⚡ **Start Focused**
1. **Select appropriate role** for primary task domain
2. **Use role memory triggers** for context loading
3. **Check `CURRENT-STATUS.md`** for session continuity
4. **Apply `/clear`** before major context switches

### ⚡ **Session Handoffs**
- **Update role memory** with key insights and decisions
- **Commit progress** with meaningful git messages
- **Update `CURRENT-STATUS.md`** with next session context
- **Reference issue tags** for traceability

### ⚡ **Context Management**
1. **Use role expertise** within defined scope
2. **Document handoff needs** in session wind-down
3. **Preserve context** in git commits and memory files
4. **Optimize for prediction accuracy** as primary success metric
