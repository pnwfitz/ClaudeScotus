# Polish public-facing docs and embed wind-down/fast-resume protocol
**Issue ID**: ISS-006  
**Opened By**: Product Manager  
**Roles Affected**: Product Manager, System Architect  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Priority**: P2  
**Status**: Open  

## Context  
Project needs polished public-facing documentation and systematic session management. Current README is functional but lacks roadmap clarity and proper wind-down/resume protocols. Missing style guide for consistent code and documentation standards. Session lifecycle needs explicit wind-down and fast-resume procedures for token limit management.

## Impact  
- Inconsistent documentation quality affects project perception
- No systematic session wind-down leads to lost context at token limits
- Missing style guide creates inconsistent code and prompt patterns
- No fast-resume protocol makes session restarts inefficient
- Documentation doesn't reflect current three-arc roadmap structure

## Proposed Resolution  
* **README.md refinement**: Add three-arc roadmap table and comprehensive wind-down/fast-resume protocol section
* **CLAUDE.md enhancement**: Add WIND_DOWN/RESUME macros, DEBUG flags, and data-path variables
* **STYLE_GUIDE.md creation**: Cover code formatting, prompt style, wind-down templates, commit patterns
* **Pre-commit extension**: Add markdown formatting checks and wind-down template validation
* **Session lifecycle formalization**: Clear protocols for session start, continuation, and wind-down phases

## Acceptance Criteria  
- README.md under 300 lines with three-arc roadmap and wind-down protocol section
- CLAUDE.md includes WIND_DOWN/RESUME macros and debug capabilities
- STYLE_GUIDE.md covers all code, documentation, and session management standards
- Pre-commit hook validates markdown formatting and wind-down templates
- Documentation reflects current project status and systematic session management
- All commits reference #ISS-006 for traceability
