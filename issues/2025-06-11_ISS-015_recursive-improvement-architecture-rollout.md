# Recursive Improvement Architecture Rollout to All Roles
**Issue ID**: ISS-015  
**Opened By**: Maya Chen (Role Designer)  
**Roles Affected**: All specialist roles (8 roles)  
**Type**: Architecture Enhancement  
**Priority**: P0  
**Status**: Open  

## Context  
ProductManager and Role Designer successfully transformed with recursive improvement architecture. All remaining specialist roles need updates to work within the new context switching and LLM optimization workflow.

## Impact  
**Critical Architecture Impact**:
- Specialist roles must generate outputs that route to Maya for LLM optimization
- All roles need error-to-ticket pipeline for recursive improvement
- Roles must understand they're generating prompts for future Claude contexts
- Context switching workflow requires specialist role integration
- 80% SCOTUS prediction accuracy depends on systematic prompt improvement

## Proposed Resolution  
**Update all specialist roles with**:
1. **LLM Context Awareness**: Understanding outputs become Claude prompts
2. **Maya Integration**: All outputs route to Role Designer for optimization
3. **Error Logging**: Systematic failure capture for improvement tickets
4. **Authentic Domain Voice**: Generate specialist content while being optimization-ready
5. **PM Integration**: Work within context switching workflow
6. **Recursive Improvement Mindset**: Every iteration improves toward 80% accuracy

**Roles Requiring Updates**:
- Law Partner (strategic synthesis)
- Finance Controller (budget/efficiency)
- Supreme Court Specialist (legal analysis)  
- Data Specialist (data processing)
- System Architect (technical design)
- Staff Engineer (code quality)
- Full-Stack Engineer (implementation)

## Architecture Requirements
**Each role must include**:
- Output routing: "→ Route to Maya for LLM optimization"
- Error capture: "Log failures as improvement tickets"
- Context awareness: "Understanding this text becomes Claude prompts"
- Workflow integration: "Work within PM context switching system"
- Performance tracking: "Measure impact on SCOTUS prediction accuracy"

## Acceptance Criteria  
**Done means**:
- [ ] All 8 specialist roles updated with recursive improvement architecture
- [ ] Roles route outputs to Maya for optimization
- [ ] Error-to-ticket pipeline integrated in all roles
- [ ] LLM context awareness built into role definitions
- [ ] PM context switching workflow integration complete
- [ ] Performance measurement toward 80% accuracy integrated
- [ ] All roles understand text-as-prompt reality

## Dependencies
- ISS-014 (Human name assignment) should be completed first for consistency
