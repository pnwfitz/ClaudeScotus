# Justice Clarence Thomas - Prediction Profile

**Appointed**: October 1991 by President Bush (41)  
**Confirmation Vote**: 52-48 (narrowest in modern history)  
**Age at Appointment**: 43  
**Background**: D.C. Circuit Judge, EEOC Chairman, Private Practice  
**Tenure**: 30+ years (most senior Associate Justice)

## Judicial Philosophy

**Core Principle**: **Aggressive Originalism**  
Thomas believes the Constitution means exactly what it meant when ratified, regardless of modern consequences or societal changes. He is the most consistent originalist on the Court and willing to overturn any precedent he views as inconsistent with original meaning.

**Key Philosophical Elements**:
- **Original Public Meaning**: Constitution means what reasonable person would have understood at time of ratification
- **Textual Literalism**: Focus on plain meaning of words, not legislative intent or purpose
- **Anti-Precedent**: Stare decisis is weak doctrine when precedent conflicts with original meaning
- **Strict Federalism**: Federal government has only enumerated powers, all else to states
- **Natural Law**: Individual rights come from natural law principles, not government grants

## Voting Patterns & Predictive Framework

### Conservative Orthodoxy (95%+ of cases)
Thomas is the most predictably conservative justice. He virtually never breaks with conservative outcomes except when originalism demands it (rare).

**Reliable Conservative Votes**:
- **Abortion**: Consistently votes to restrict or eliminate abortion rights
- **Gun Rights**: Strong Second Amendment maximalist
- **Religious Liberty**: Robust protection for religious exercise and expression
- **Affirmative Action**: Consistently opposes race-based preferences
- **Criminal Law**: Generally pro-prosecution, though originalist constraints apply
- **Business Regulation**: Skeptical of federal regulatory power

### Originalist Departures (1-2% of cases)
Thomas will occasionally reach liberal outcomes when originalism requires it:
- **Criminal Procedure**: Sometimes supports defendant rights when original meaning clear
- **Property Rights**: May limit government taking power based on founding-era understanding
- **Free Speech**: Strong protection even for offensive speech

## Key Case Areas for Prediction

### Constitutional Structure
**Pattern**: **Extremely Conservative**  
**Key Cases**: Extensive Commerce Clause limitations, anti-administrative state positions

### Race and Civil Rights
**Pattern**: **Consistently Conservative**  
**Key Cases**: Opposes affirmative action, voting rights enforcement

## Bottom Line for 2Ls

Thomas is the **most predictable justice** because he has an unwavering judicial philosophy and consistently applies it. He will vote conservatively in 95%+ of cases. The only surprises come when pure originalist analysis leads to liberal outcomes, which is rare.

**Most Predictable**: Abortion, gun rights, religious liberty, federal power, administrative law  
**Least Predictable**: Criminal procedure cases with clear founding-era precedents  
**Wild Card Factor**: His willingness to overturn major precedents that other conservatives might preserve for institutional reasons

**Key Insight**: Thomas doesn't care about political consequences, institutional legitimacy, or gradual change. He wants to restore what he sees as the original constitutional structure immediately. This makes him extremely reliable for conservative outcomes but occasionally surprising when originalism leads elsewhere.
